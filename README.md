# React

React is an efficient, flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It uses a special markup language called JSX. The main benefits of using JSX are that you can leverage the full power of JavaScript in HTML and avoid learning or using a templating language.

A React application is a tree of components and an extension of the HTML DOM.

Create a React application

```sh
npx create-react-app <nombre>
```

Install Redux packages

```sh
npm install --save redux react-redux
```
