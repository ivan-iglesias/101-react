# JSX

JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML) is a declarative language that combines JS with HTML. It makes React code much easier to read, write and understand.

JSX syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors, for example, transpilers or compiler like Babel, to transform HTML-like text found in JS files into standard JS objects.

```jsx
const el1 = <h1>This is a sample JSX code snippet</h1>
```
